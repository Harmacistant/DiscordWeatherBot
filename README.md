# DiscordWeatherBot

This project is intended to serve as a utility bot on Discord.  Its intended uses involve alerting users via DM when severe or extreme weather is announced based on their set preferences, or alerting a channel in a server.  All alerts are currently sourced via [NOAA](http://alerts.weather.gov) - more sources to be added later.

This is just a hobby project - a way for me to get to know github and learn some practical python.  It should _not_ be relied upon as an official alert system.
